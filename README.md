# One-way-hash
This assignment concerns hash functions and Message Authentication Code (MAC).

To run the CountBits.java program:  
```openssl dgst <hash-algo> -hmac <key> <file```  
```java CountBits --h1 <hash1> --h2 <hash2>```

To run the CollisionResistance.java program one only has to compile and run since the values are hardcoded.
``` javac CollisionResistance.java ``` 
``` java CollisionResistance ```
